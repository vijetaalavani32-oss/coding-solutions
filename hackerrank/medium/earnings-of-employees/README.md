## Problem

We define an employee's *total earnings* to be their monthly $salary \times  months$ worked, and the *maximum total earnings* to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the **Employee** table. Write a query to find the _maximum total earnings_ for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as $2$ space-separated integers.

**Input Format**

The **Employee** table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

where _employee\_id_ is an employee's ID number, _name_ is their name, _months_ is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and _salary_ is the their monthly salary.
